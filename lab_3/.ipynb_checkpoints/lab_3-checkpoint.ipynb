    "## Description of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the problem is to find the most efficien t possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic version of the problem, the salesman picks a city to start, travels through remaining cities and returns to the original city. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we have slightly modified the problem, presenting it as a tank filling delivery problem on a 2D gridworld.  The agent (driver) starts at the chemical depot, a fixed point on the grid.  Then, the tanks appear elsewhere on the grid.  The driver needs to visit the the tanks to obtain rewards.  Rewards are proportional to the time taken to do this (equivalent to the distance, as each timestep moves one square on the grid)."

    "## Easy Version\n",
    "In the Easy Version, we are on a very small grid.  All tank locations are generated at the start of the episode.  Tank locations are fixed, and are invariant (non-random) from episode to episode.  The objective is to visit each tank location, and return to the depot.  We have a maximum time-limit of 50 steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### States\n",
    "At each time step, our agent is aware of the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the Chemical Depot:\n",
    "    1. Location (x,y coordinates)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. For the Driver\n",
    "    1. Location (x,y coordinates)\n",
    "    2. Is driver at depot (yes/no)\n",

    "    2. Time remaining until end of episode (i.e. until max time)\n",

    "### Actions\n",
    "At each time step, our agent can take the following steps:\n",
    "- Up - Move one step up in the map\n",
    "- Down - Move one step down in the map\n",
    "- Right - Move one step right in the map\n",
    "- Left - Move one step left in the map\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards\n",
    "Agent gets a reward of -1 for each time step. If an tank is visited in that timestep, it gets a positive reward inversely proportional to the time taken to deliver. If all the tanks are visited and the agent is back to the depot, it gets an additional reward inversely proportional to time since start of episode. \n"
